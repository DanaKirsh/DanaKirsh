### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dana, and I'm a software engineer at [Capsule](https://capsulecrm.com/). I started off as a backend engineer, working on our API using Scala, but more recently have been working on our frontend, using [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js), as well as working on some of our integrations with other services.
